In this version, a projection of the synthesized future is made, generated by the artificial intelligence algorithm in the 3D space of the present, in the form of an Ai-sculpture. The result is a spatio-temporal distortion that turns the smartphone screen into a potential wormhole.

The project consists of an AR filter that is available on the Instagram and Facebook platforms and can be used by anyone. For the finest possible performance, it is best to use it outdoors.
