The artwork uses data and artificial intelligence algorithms to study the quality of life of the past to synthesize and capture the life of the future. In the flow of data, it detects coded omens invisible to the human eye, making its precepts hidden in plain sight. Thus, the future appears before us, although visible yet unexplained, until the replacement of the artificial by the cooperative.

For the creation of this project, indicators of quality of life were studied according to the European Statistical Office. Based on these, a set of terms that describe them was constructed. Then, the terms were used in the application of the data scraping technique to construct audio and video data sets. The collected data was fed to two artificial intelligence algorithms whose outputs, after processing, led to the audiovisual result.
