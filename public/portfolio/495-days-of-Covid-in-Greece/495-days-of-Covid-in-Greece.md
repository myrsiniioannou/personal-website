Unquestionably, the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event in modern history. It changed our daily lives radically, if not once and for all. It shook our perception of human relations, work, politics, economic expediency amid a crisis and many other aspects of our lives. It mobilized us, restrained us, scared us, strengthened us, and changed us, radically.

The ways to accept and interpret this ongoing experience are numerous and varied. Undoubtedly, however, the correlation with nature is inevitable. As the planet warms and climate change evolves, the risk of pandemics increases. Î¤herefore, it is impossible not to associate the global pandemic and possibly the future ones with the climate crisis.

This project consists of sonification and visualization of data of COVID-19 from Greece, collected within 495 days from the appearance of the pandemic in the country. The data include the daily number of cases, the daily number of deaths, weekly ICU admissions and hospitalizations, reproduction rate and lastly, the daily number of new vaccinations, symbolically, as suspicion of optimism. Depending on the fluctuation of data, parts of the composition are affected, change or evolve.
